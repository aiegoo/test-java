}
// The output of the fixed code will be the result of the compute method in the Child class when called with the argument 4.
// The output of the code is 1.
// The code defines two classes: Parent and Child. The Parent class has a method compute that computes a value based on the input number. The Child class extends the Parent class and overrides the compute method with a different logic to compute the value.
// In the main method, an instance of the Child class is created but referred to with the Parent type. The compute method is called with the input 4, which triggers the overridden logic in the Child class. The overridden logic computes the value as the sum of the values computed by calling the compute method recursively with num - 1 and num - 3. The final result is 1, which is printed to the console.
// The key concept demonstrated in this code is method overriding in Java, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where the method called on a superclass reference can execute the overridden implementation in the subclass.

// compute(2) = compute(1) + compute(-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0
// compute(3) = compute(2) + compute(0) = 0 + 0 = 0
// compute(4) = compute(3) + compute(1) = 0 + 1 = 1
