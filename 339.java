// The output of the program will be:
// B
// D
// C
// D
// D
// Explanation:
// Class Definitions:
// 
// SuperObject:
// draw(): Prints "A".
// paint(): Prints "B" and then calls draw().
// SubObject:
// Inherits from SuperObject.
// Overrides draw(): Prints "D".
// Overrides paint(): Calls super.paint(), prints "C", and then calls draw().
// Main Method Execution:
// 
// SuperObject s = new SubObject();: Creates an instance of SubObject and assigns it to a SuperObject reference s.
// s.paint();: Calls the overridden paint() method in SubObject.
// super.paint();: Calls the paint() method in SuperObject.
// Prints "B".
// Calls draw(): Since s is an instance of SubObject, it calls the overridden draw() method in SubObject, which prints "D".
// Prints "C".
// Calls draw(): Calls the overridden draw() method in SubObject, which prints "D".
// s.draw();: Calls the overridden draw() method in SubObject, which prints "D".
// Explanation:
// 1. The main method creates an instance of SubObject and assigns it to a SuperObject reference s.
// 2. When s.paint() is called, the paint method of SubObject is executed. This method first calls super.paint(), which calls the paint method of SuperObject. The paint method of SuperObject prints "B" and then calls draw(). Since draw() is overridden in SubObject, the overridden draw method in SubObject is called, which prints "D".
// 3. After the call to super.paint() completes, the SubObject paint method prints "C" and then calls draw() again, which calls the overridden draw method in SubObject and prints "D".
// 4. When s.draw() is called, the overridden draw method in SubObject is called directly, printing "D".
// The key concept demonstrated in this code is method overriding in Java, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where the method called on a superclass reference can execute the overridden implementation in the subclass.
// The code also demonstrates the concept of method recursion, where a method calls itself either directly or indirectly. In this case, the draw method in SuperObject calls itself recursively, leading to a stack overflow error due to infinite recursion.
