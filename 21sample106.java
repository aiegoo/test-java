### Step-by-step explanation with variable changes:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `String a = "Technology";` → The string 'a' is initialized with the value "Technology".
   - `int i = 0, hap = 0;` → The variable `i` is the index counter, starting at 0, and `hap` is the count of 'o's, starting at 0.

2. **First Iteration (`i = 0`):**
   - The character at index `i = 0` is `'T'` (`a.charAt(0) = 'T'`).
   - `'T' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 0.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 1`.

3. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`):**
   - The character at index `i = 1` is `'e'` (`a.charAt(1) = 'e'`).
   - `'e' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 0.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 2`.

4. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`):**
   - The character at index `i = 2` is `'c'` (`a.charAt(2) = 'c'`).
   - `'c' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 0.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 3`.

5. **Fourth Iteration (`i = 3`):**
   - The character at index `i = 3` is `'h'` (`a.charAt(3) = 'h'`).
   - `'h' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 0.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 4`.

6. **Fifth Iteration (`i = 4`):**
   - The character at index `i = 4` is `'n'` (`a.charAt(4) = 'n'`).
   - `'n' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 0.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 5`.

7. **Sixth Iteration (`i = 5`):**
   - The character at index `i = 5` is `'o'` (`a.charAt(5) = 'o'`).
   - `'o' == 'o'`, so `hap` is incremented by 1 → `hap = 1`.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 6`.

8. **Seventh Iteration (`i = 6`):**
   - The character at index `i = 6` is `'l'` (`a.charAt(6) = 'l'`).
   - `'l' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 1.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 7`.

9. **Eighth Iteration (`i = 7`):**
   - The character at index `i = 7` is `'o'` (`a.charAt(7) = 'o'`).
   - `'o' == 'o'`, so `hap` is incremented by 1 → `hap = 2`.
   - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 8`.

10. **Ninth Iteration (`i = 8`):**
    - The character at index `i = 8` is `'g'` (`a.charAt(8) = 'g'`).
    - `'g' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 2.
    - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 9`.

11. **Tenth Iteration (`i = 9`):**
    - The character at index `i = 9` is `'y'` (`a.charAt(9) = 'y'`).
    - `'y' != 'o'`, so `hap` remains 2.
    - Increment `i` by 1 → `i = 10`.

12. **End of Loop:**
    - The loop terminates when `i = 10`, which is the length of the string (`a.length() = 10`).

### Final Output:
The final value of `hap` is **2**, which means there are **two 'o' characters** in the string "Technology".

The program prints:
```
2
```
